//! CONSTELLATION PATCH (io-uring): this whole file is Constellation's, not upstream
//! fuser's (vendor/fuser/CONSTELLATION-PATCH.md, patches/0002-io-uring-transport.patch).
//!
//! One ring: its entries, their state machine, the commit protocol and the ring thread's loop.
//!
//! Every SQE of a ring is pushed and submitted by the ring's own thread. Other threads reply by
//! writing the entry's buffers under the entry state machine, queueing the entry in
//! `Live::pending` and waking the ring thread through an eventfd. Lock order is an entry's
//! `state`, then `live`; neither is held while buffers are written or the io_uring is used.
