Unit tests: 48 across fs-core / store-s3 / meta / cli. End-to-end smoke
test green on both the local-file backend and floci S3 (host and fully
containerized lanes). pjdfstest: full pass, no exclusions. Harness: 9
fault-injection scenarios green (S3 outage/flap/latency/bandwidth,
crash+remount, cold cache, fresh-node bootstrap).

### Remaining for phase 1

Nothing — see the exit criteria below.

### Phase 1 exit criteria (ROADMAP.md)

- [x] pjdfstest passes — full pass (8798/8798), empty failure baseline
- [x] kill -9 + remount recovers — harness `kill9-remount` scenario verifies
      committed state survives SIGKILL across three crash/remount rounds
- [x] census-scale import measured — `harness bench` baseline (20k x 4 KiB
      files against local floci S3): import ~545 files/s durable-in-S3,
      metadata walk ~418k files/s, cold read-back ~31k files/s. The
      import rate is serial-flush bound (one chunk PUT + manifest per
      close through the single-threaded FUSE loop); parallel writeback
      is the known phase-2+ lever.

**Verdict: phase 1 is functionally complete.** Durability (metadata log
+ checkpoints + fresh-node bootstrap), crash recovery, readahead, spool
observability, and the benchmark baseline are all in and verified by
the oracle-based harness.

## Known design-debt in the current code (fix within phase 1)

- `flush_inode` re-cuts only the final chunk on shrink; a truncate to a
  non-chunk boundary followed by extension needs a targeted test.
- Writes buffer dirty chunks in memory per inode until flush; fine for
  phase-1 file sizes, but the eager-upload path (DESIGN.md streaming
  writes) is not implemented yet.
- `setattr` journals a redundant record when invoked for truncate (size
  is also recorded by the subsequent `write_manifest`).

## Phase 2 — Second node, close-to-open: **DONE**

| Item | State | Where |
|---|---|---|
| Node registry: CAS-claimed cluster-unique node ids | done | `store-s3::nodes` |
| Node-scoped ino allocation (`prefix << 40 \| counter`) — concurrent nodes can never collide | done | `meta::sqlite` |
| Segment envelope (`{v, node, records}`, versioned; legacy bare arrays decode as node 0) | done | `cli::shipper` |
| Log tailing + replica application (poll + on-demand, contiguous-run ordering) | done | `cli::shipper::Shipper::sync` |
| Convergent replay: last-wins upsert semantics, idempotent under checkpoint/segment overlap | done | `meta::replay` |
| Leaseless conflict handling: foreign records touching pending local state are skipped (ours are later in the log and win everywhere); counted + logged, surfaced via control API | done | `meta::replay::TouchSet`, `cli::shipper` |
| Multi-writer CAS collision: loser re-tails and retries at the next sequence | done | `cli::shipper` |
| Crash-atomic ack (journal ack + applied-seq in one tx) | done | `meta::sqlite::ack_journal_at` |
| Publication point: close() nudges an immediate sync round | done | `cli::fusefs_ops` |
| fsync modes: `--fsync-mode local` (default) / `s3` (fsync blocks until the record is durable in the shared log) | done | `cli::{main,fusefs}` |
| Checkpoints strip node identity (a restored node claims its own id/counter) | done | `meta::replay::snapshot` |
| Two-node convergence unit tests (disjoint, same-name conflict, sequential cross-edits, lost-response recovery) | done | `cli::shipper` tests |
| Harness scenarios: `two-clients-shared`, `git-workflow` | done | `crates/harness` |

### Phase 2 exit criteria (ROADMAP.md)

- [x] Two nodes mount concurrently with close-to-open semantics through
      S3 alone (no P2P) — `two-clients-shared` model-verifies each
      node's subtree through the *other* node's mount every block
- [x] Simulation layer green for two-node histories — in-process
      convergence tests over a shared in-memory object store cover
      disjoint writes, same-name conflicts (deterministic last-wins,
      never silent), sequential cross-node edits, and lost-response
      recovery
- [x] git-workflow scenario clean — stage/publish/edit ping-pong with
      exact content verification in both directions

Known phase-2 scope limits (by design, lifted in phase 3): concurrent
conflicting writes to the *same* dentry/inode from two nodes resolve
deterministically (log order) but are only detected+logged, not
prevented — leases make them impossible in the default mode; attribute
and entry invalidation is TTL-based (1 s) rather than push-based, so
cross-node visibility is sync-interval + TTL, not gossip-RTT.

## Phase 3 — Leases + P2P fast path: **IN PROGRESS**

### M3.1 — single-partition (p0) lease-based write authority

| Item | State | Where |
|---|---|---|
| Lease object (`{v, partition, holder, epoch, expires_unix_ms, released}`) + `LeaseStore` CAS create/renew/release over `PutMode::Create`/`Update{etag}` | done | `store-s3::lease` |
| `LeaseMode::SingleWriter` fallback for backends without `If-Match` (e.g. `file://`): swaps degrade to unconditional PUTs, exclusion assumed not enforced, loud warning on mount | done | `store-s3::lease`, `cli::main` |
| `LeaseKeeper` state machine: classify → commit, renew at half-TTL, idle release (`CONSTELLATION_LEASE_IDLE_RELEASE_MS`, default 2000 ms), deposition detection (renew CAS failure → permanently `lost`) | done | `cli::lease` |
| Takeover ordering enforced structurally: a handover claim requires a `TailedToHead` witness that only the shipper's tail can mint | done | `cli::lease`, `cli::shipper::acquire_lease` |
| `LeaseView` lock-free snapshot (atomics) for the FUSE write gate — nanosecond fast path when held, hands off to the sync task only when not currently usable | done | `cli::lease`, `cli::fusefs` |
| FUSE write gate: every mutating op (not reads) blocks on `require_lease()`, bounded wait ~2×TTL then EIO; a deposed node refuses immediately | done | `cli::fusefs`, `cli::fusefs_ops` |
| Segments stamped with the lease epoch; shipping refused without a usable lease; a segment with an epoch below the max observed is a fencing violation and is skipped, not applied | done | `cli::shipper` |
| Sync task: `Acquire` requests preempt an in-flight ship/renew round (nested `select!` with a pending-request queue) so a FUSE thread waiting on the lease is never stuck behind S3's multi-minute retry budget | done | `cli::main` |
| Control API: `StatusReport.lease: {held, holder, epoch, expires_in_ms, lost}` | done | `crates/api` |
| Harness: `Client::pause()`/`resume()` (SIGSTOP/SIGCONT), `lease-handover` (cooperative idle-release handover, epoch advances, zero conflicts), `lease-fencing` (SIGSTOP the holder, peer takes over after TTL expiry, resumed holder detects deposition and refuses to ship) | done | `crates/harness` |
| Unit tests: CAS create/renew/expired-takeover/epoch-bump/release/CAS-conflict-loser (`store-s3::lease`), acquire-before-ship/refuse-when-deposed/epoch-in-envelope/takeover-tail-ordering (`cli::shipper`) | done | `store-s3::lease`, `cli::shipper` tests |

### Phase 3 exit criteria (ROADMAP.md)

- [x] Single-authority invariant holds under simulated partitions — the
      `lease-fencing` harness scenario freezes the holder (SIGSTOP),
      lets a peer take over after TTL expiry (only after tailing the
      frozen holder's flushed log), and verifies the resumed holder
      detects its own deposition, refuses to ship, and that the
      deposed node's stranded journal never reaches the shared log or
      corrupts the new holder's namespace. `two-clients-shared` and
      `git-workflow` both assert `conflicts == 0` on every node: the
      leaseless convergence path is unreachable in normal operation.
- [ ] Lease transfer ~1 RTT when peers connected — not yet: no P2P
      exists (M3.3). Today's handover latency is the idle-release
      window (default 2 s) plus one CAS round trip, not a gossip push;
      `lease-handover`'s wall-clock is the baseline to compare once
      P2P lands.

### M3.1 scope limits (by design, addressed in later M3.x / phase 4)

- **Handover latency**: without P2P a holder cannot know a peer is
  waiting, so cooperative hand-back is time-based (write-idle for
  `CONSTELLATION_LEASE_IDLE_RELEASE_MS`), not push-based. A peer
  contending for a busy lease otherwise waits out the full TTL.
- **Stranded-journal reintegration**: a deposed holder's unshipped
  journal is preserved on local disk but has no path back into the
  shared log. Reintegration is phase 4 scope.
- **Single partition**: the whole filesystem is one lease (`p0`).
  Partition split/merge and cross-partition rename are M3.2.

## Later phases

Not started (phases 4–8, and M3.2/M3.3 of phase 3). No code exists for
partition split/merge, P2P/gossip, pin/offline, cooperative cache,
snapshots/E2E, web UI, or GC.
